      ## A Letter From Clint


      Hi there! I'm Clint, the owner and tradesman here at United Roofing and
      Construction Services.


      Ever since I was young, I was taught that honesty, integrity, and hard
      work are the ingredients to success. Of course, as a young man, I didn’t
      fully comprehend it then, but eventually, I realized just how true that
      statement really is.


      With that lesson in mind, I started my journey in full-time construction
      when I was fifteen years old, but this family business began in 2002. I
      pride myself on doing everything from the ground up: from digging the
      first footers all the way through framing, roofing, and tiling, before
      adding the finishing touches with high-quality carpentry. This wide range
      of specialties gave me the unique privilege of building my family's home -
      something not everyone gets a chance to do. That skillset also opened up a
      lot of opportunities in my career, and I’m very grateful for them, but
      most importantly, I’m thankful for all the close relationships that I
      established with homeowners, builders, suppliers, and workers over the
      decades.


      Now that I'm a father myself, I'm passing on to my daughters that same
      lesson — that honesty, integrity, and hard work are what matter most in
      life — and I'm proud to be bringing that attitude to construction in the
      Charleston, SC area. If that sounds like someone you want to work with,
      give me a call at (843) 408-5752.


      Sincerely,


      Clint Mansergh
